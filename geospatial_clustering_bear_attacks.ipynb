His body was partially consumed and covered. Puncture wounds on his arms indicated he had tried to defend himself. Based on the presence of a sow grizzly and a cub in the area, the sow was deemed responsible for the attack. The sow was captured and killed after it was found to be the bear that killed Crosby.[56][57] There were public appeals to not kill the sow, but the park superintendent decided there was a risk the sow might kill again; based on July 6, 2011 and August 24, 2011 killings in the park, where another sow was present at both those killings.[58] &quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;: &quot; male&quot;, &quot;Latitude&quot;: 44.976350000000025, &quot;Location&quot;: &quot;Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming&quot;, &quot;Longitude&quot;: -110.69993999999996, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Lance Crosby&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;bbox&quot;: [-132.710132, 60.16808800000007, -132.710132, 60.16808800000007], &quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [-132.710132, 60.16808800000007], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;79&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Age&quot;: &quot; 42&quot;, &quot;Bear&quot;: &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;: &quot;October 14, 2014&quot;, &quot;Details&quot;: &quot;A 25-year-old healthy male grizzly bear broke into a home and chased the victim and her husband outside.

The bear was a sow with a 1\\u00bd-year-old male cub.[51] The hunter and his guide were dressing an elk carcass and had left a canister of bear spray and a Glock 20 pistol out of reach. As the bear attacked, Chubon, unfamiliar with the operation of a Glock pistol, was unable to fire and attempted to throw it at Uptain who failed to catch it. The bear turned on Uptain. Chubon fled with injuries as the bear attacked Uptain. After staggering 50 yards (46\\u00a0m) uphill from the dead elk, Uptain was killed by the mother and possibly by the cub as well.

His body was partially consumed and covered. Puncture wounds on his arms indicated he had tried to defend himself. Based on the presence of a sow grizzly and a cub in the area, the sow was deemed responsible for the attack. The sow was captured and killed after it was found to be the bear that killed Crosby.[56][57] There were public appeals to not kill the sow, but the park superintendent decided there was a risk the sow might kill again; based on July 6, 2011 and August 24, 2011 killings in the park, where another sow was present at both those killings.[58] &quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;: &quot; male&quot;, &quot;Latitude_1&quot;: 44.976350000000025, &quot;Latitude_2&quot;: 44.976350000000025, &quot;Location&quot;: &quot;Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming&quot;, &quot;Longitude_1&quot;: -110.69993999999996, &quot;Longitude_2&quot;: -110.69993999999996, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Lance Crosby&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;bbox&quot;: [-110.69993999999996, 44.976350000000025, -110.69993999999996, 44.976350000000025], &quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [-110.69993999999996, 44.976350000000025], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;68&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Age&quot;: &quot; 59&quot;, &quot;Bear&quot;: &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;: &quot;August 24, 2011&quot;, &quot;Details&quot;: &quot;Wallace\\u0027s remains were found by hikers on the Mary Mountain Trail, northeast of Old Faithful.[67] Wallace was hiking alone.[68] An autopsy showed that Wallace died from a bear attack.[68] According to a report released by Yellowstone rangers, park officials had attempted to give Wallace a lecture about bear safety, but he was not interested, calling himself a \\&quot;grizzly bear expert\\&quot;.[69] DNA evidence later determined that the same sow that killed Brian Matayoshi July 6, 2011 was in the vicinity of Wallace\\u0027s corpse, though it was not proved that this bear killed Wallace. The bear was killed by park officials.[70] Evidence showed that Wallace was attacked after sitting down on a log to eat a snack and the attack was predatory, rather than defensive.[70][71]  &quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;: &quot; male&quot;, &quot;Latitude_1&quot;: 44.976350000000025, &quot;Latitude_2&quot;: 44.976350000000025, &quot;Location&quot;: &quot;Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming&quot;, &quot;Longitude_1&quot;: -110.69993999999996, &quot;Longitude_2&quot;: -110.69993999999996, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;John Wallace&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;bbox&quot;: [-110.69993999999996, 44.976350000000025, -110.69993999999996, 44.976350000000025], &quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [-110.69993999999996, 44.976350000000025], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;69&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Age&quot;: &quot; 57&quot;, &quot;Bear&quot;: &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;: &quot;July 6, 2011&quot;, &quot;Details&quot;: &quot;Matayoshi and his wife were hiking the Wapiti Lake Trail, and came upon a mother grizzly bear in an open meadow.

She was not injured.[72][73] An initial investigation by the National Park Service found the bear\\u0027s actions were defensive against a perceived threat to her cubs. Since the attack was not predatory and the bear had no known violent history towards humans, no immediate action was taken towards the bear, the bear was later killed after it was found to be at the site of another fatal attack August 24, 2011.[70][72][73] A later investigation determined that the couple\\u0027s running from the bear was a mistake, and the fatal attack was a \\&quot;one in 3 million occurrence\\&quot;.[74]  &quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;: &quot; male&quot;, &quot;Latitude_1&quot;: 44.976350000000025, &quot;Latitude_2&quot;: 44.976350000000025, &quot;Location&quot;: &quot;Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming&quot;, &quot;Longitude_1&quot;: -110.69993999999996, &quot;Longitude_2&quot;: -110.69993999999996, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Brian Matayoshi&quot;}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;bbox&quot;: [-110.69993999999996, 44.976350000000025, -110.69993999999996, 44.976350000000025], &quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [-110.69993999999996, 44.976350000000025], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;70&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;Age&quot;: &quot; 38&quot;, &quot;Bear&quot;: &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;: &quot;October 5, 1986&quot;, &quot;Details&quot;: &quot;Tesinkey, a photographer, was mauled after approaching a bear in the Otter Creek area of Hayden Valley, Yellowstone National Park.
